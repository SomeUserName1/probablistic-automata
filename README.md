#### TODOs
- [x] Write Thesis Proposal  

#### Software TODOs (Optional)  
- [ ] Implementation of rewriting system algorithm (WIP)  
- [ ] Parser for ODE  
- [ ] higher order ODE to system of first order ODEs  
- [ ] ODE to rewriting system conversion
- [ ] ODE benchmark   
- [ ] Compare minimizations, in terms of speed, memory & coherrence   

Optional:  
- WA:  
- [ ] Check if Q matrix (i.e. product of householder reflectors) helps with basis   
    (with F forward basis: QF = F' such that F' triangular, thus F'mu more sparse) 

- DE/RS:
- [ ] impl support non-polynomial functions using power & taylor series expansion, symmetries/periodicity, laurent polynomials, ...  
- [ ] impl. DE version with z3

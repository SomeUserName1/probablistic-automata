# Repository containing materials for the Master's project & thesis

### Topics:  
1. Multi-layered Networks  
    Possible goals:  
    1. Project: Apply framework to sample problems, see what is out there and how it is to be modeled with the given tools  
    2. Thesis: Theoretic framework for assigning dynamics to MLNs and elaborate on the properties (expressiveness, equivalence to other approaches, compositionality, ...)  
2. Missing piece in relationship between ODEs and stochastic semantics  
    Possible goal:  
    1. Project: Maybe validate equivalence by computation (Thesis result'd be fixed before the project?)  
    2. Thesis: Elaborate and proof the nature of the relationship   
3. Minimisation of MC  
    Possible goals:  
    1. Implement minimisation algorithm  
    2. extend to countably infinite state scenario (?)

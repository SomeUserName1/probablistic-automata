# Repository containing materials for the Master's project & thesis

### Possible Topics:  
1. Minimisation of Probabilistic Automata  
    Possible goals: 
    1. Project: Implement minimisation algorithms for PA & WA on examples.  
    2. Thesis: Extension of an algorithm, ?  
2. Multi-layered Networks  
    Possible goals: 
    1. Project: Apply framework to sample problems, see what is out there and how it is to be modeled with the given tools  
    2. Thesis: Theoretic framework for assigning dynamics to MLNs and elaborate on the properties (expressiveness, equivalence to other approaches, compositionality, ...)  
3. Missing piece in relationship between ODEs and stochastic semantics  
    Possible goal:  
    1. Project: Maybe validate equivalence by computation (Thesis result'd be fixed before the project?)  
    2. Thesis: Elaborate and proof the nature of the relationship   


### Organisation  
- Attend group meetings on Friday, 10.30 am  
- Timeline & 2 page Proposal before project registration

## TODOs  
- [ ] Quick Recap PMFCS course  
- [ ] Dig into the topics  
- [ ] Formulate and list questions  
- [ ] Decide for something  
- [ ] Start the Proposal draft  
- [ ] Check neccessary forms  
- [ ] Do all PMFCS course exercises  

## Questions  
- Is a combination of the topics possible? E.g. How do DAE/ODE related to different PA models and is it possible to derive a minimisation of a certain PA class from the corresponding ODE/DAE    
- Would a neuro-oriented example be suitable for the MLNs (layers imposed by temporal ordering, spatial scale, histology)  
- Do PA capture all possible stochastic semantics? Do ODEs/DAEs capture all possible stochastic semantics?  
- Are the goals filled in (and not provided by Tanja) above suitable? what would better ones be?

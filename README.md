# Repository containing materials for the Master's project & thesis

### Topics:  
1. Multi-layered Networks  
    Possible goals:  
    1. Project: Apply framework to sample problems, see what is out there and how it is to be modeled with the given tools  
    2. Thesis: Theoretic framework for assigning dynamics to MLNs and elaborate on the properties (expressiveness, equivalence to other approaches, compositionality, ...)  
2. Missing piece in relationship between ODEs and stochastic semantics  
    Possible goal:  
    1. Project: Maybe validate equivalence by computation (Thesis result'd be fixed before the project?)  
    2. Thesis: Elaborate and proof the nature of the relationship   


### Organisation  
- Attend group meetings on Friday, 10.30 am  
- Timeline & 2 page Proposal before project registration  

## TODOs  
- [x] Quick Recap PMFCS course  
- [x] Dig into the topics  
- [-] Formulate and list questions  
- [x] Decide for something  
- [ ] Start the Proposal draft  
- [ ] Check neccessary forms  
- [ ] Do all PMFCS course exercises  

## Questions  
- Is a combination of the topics possible? E.g. How do DAE/ODE related to different PA models and and the application of dynamic processes to MLNs with respect to optimal traits (executability, succintness, expressiveness)    
- Would a neuro-oriented example be suitable for the MLNs (layers imposed by temporal ordering, spatial scale, histology)  
- Do PA capture all possible stochastic semantics? Do ODEs/DAEs capture all possible stochastic semantics?  
- Are the goals filled in (and not provided by Tanja) above suitable? what would better ones be?  
- What other relevant stochastic processes exist?  
- Formalisms for specifying Markovian Population Models, p. 8 & 9: Law of mass action vector is in example on p 9 not a vector?! what does the vector mean and why can it be reduced to 1D?  
- Are all Systems reducible to fullfill the markov property if one has an infinite mount of memory?  
- Can non-linear systems be modelled by ODEs or does one need DAEs? When are ODEs insufficient and one needs DAEs? When is the determinant of the Jacobi-M. 0 and when is it not (intuitively)? Is a DAE a PDE where at least one variable's derivative is not used/free?
